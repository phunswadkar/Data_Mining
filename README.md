Data Mining | Supervised Learning Methods to Predict the Quality of Red Wine

Throughout centuries of history, wine has retained its status as a cherished beverage enjoyed across the globe. However, the evaluation of wine quality historically relied on subjective and time-consuming methods. Consequently, our aim was to employ data-driven approaches, including machine learning, to predict wine quality by utilizing measurable physicochemical attributes. 

To achieve this, we analyzed a dataset of red wine samples, conducted data cleaning, partitioned the data, and trained several supervised learning algorithms which include Classification Tree, Ordinal Logistic Regression and Neural Network Model. Our primary objective was to demonstrate the potential of these techniques in predicting wine quality and to gain valuable insights into the physicochemical factors that impact the quality of red wine.
